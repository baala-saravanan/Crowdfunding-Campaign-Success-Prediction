# Crowdfunding-Campaign-Success-Prediction

The goal of this assignment is to develop and evaluate predictive classifier models to determine the success of crowdfunding campaigns based on a variety of campaign features. The dataset includes factors such as financial goals, actual funds raised, campaign duration, and backer engagement. By building and comparing three distinct machine learning models â€” Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) and assess which model best predicts the success of crowdfunding efforts.
